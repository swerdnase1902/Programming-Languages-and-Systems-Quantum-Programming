The U_f matrix is for f(x) = x, i.e. the identity function

How to construct this U_f?

Should be easy. First we notice U_f |x>|b> = |x>|b+f(x)>

for x,b we plug in all 4 combinations, namely:
x=0, b=0
x=0, b=1
x=1, b=0
x=1, b=1

Now, we have a system of matrix equation:
U_f |0>|0> = |0>|0>
U_f |0>|1> = |0>|1>
U_f |1>|0> = |1>|1>
U_f |1>|1> = |1>|0>

Solve for U_f and we notice that U_f happens to be C(X).

We then can use CX in the Deutsh circuit. We can verify the correctness of this circuit by noticing
that the the 1st qubit has 100% taking the value |1> which represents a balanced function (as expected).
